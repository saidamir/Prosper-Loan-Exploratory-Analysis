Exploratory data analysis of Prosper Loans in R - summary. 

Large dataset with many factor variables.
The context of loan related information like APR, Credit Score, Lender Credit Score is familiar to many, however, it should be noted that this is a niche lending.
Prosper specializes in short term risky cash loans and usual assuptions may not always apply there. 
For example there is no clear correlation between credit score and APR. Also some income levels and professions were not getting low APRs as expected. 
Prosper is a niche lender serving the market not covered by traditional banking - i.e. those who exhausted other options or who were not granted loans by banks. 
It was interesting to explore occupation vs credit ratings (both Prosper and Credit Score) and it gave lots of insights to the data. 
I would further research on what Prosper bases its rating - what is the most important factor? Is it income level, number of loans, debt to income ratio? Does state location have any bearing on the Prosper rating and APR?
